# final-project-analysis-
This is my final project for my Social statistics course. I completed an analysis of the Absent problems in school districts across New Jersey schools. I analyzed the effects absent issues have on grades and the effects of grades on absent issues. I compared the differences in the absent problem in lower education schools and high schools.
