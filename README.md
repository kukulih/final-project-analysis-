# final-project-analysis-
This is my final project for my Social statistics course. I completed an analysis of the Absent problems in school districts across New Jersey schools. I analyzed the effects absent issues have on grades and the effects of grades on absent issues. I compared the differences in the absent problem in lower education schools and high schools. 

Instructions:
To utilize the script, open the "kukulih1 file that contains my code for the findings, a the "final project analysis.R"

DATA: 
The data collected for this analysis was all of the absent and grades offered issues across the school districts across New Jersey school districts. The question being asked was how the grades being offered affect absent issues across schools or if the absent issues affected the grades being offered across schools. Each unit of analysis is one school.

I gathered the data by researching the school districts and gathering the data. It was difficult searching for every school district but each one showed the grades being offered with the absent problems as a number across all New Jersey school districts. 

Operationalizm:
The concept of grades being offered was operationalized by picking the common absent issues that were high across schools districts using a qualitative variable. These being: "absent_problem" and "grades_offered"

The concept of absent problem was operationalized by researching the the school districts, especially specializing highschools that were effected by a high to low ratio of absent problems. This was a qualitative variable. 

The concept grades being offered was operationalized through a quantitative variable counting the grades offered across school districts. 

I operationalized this in a data chart labeled "yes" and "no" variables to say the effects across school districts.
